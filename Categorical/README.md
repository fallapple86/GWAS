# Data 
## GWAS Catalog
...GWAS Catalog is a collection of all published GWAS assaying at least 100,000 SNPs and all SNP-trait associations with p-values < 1.0 * 10^-5
...This project mainly focuses on the data from GWAS Catalog. You can download data through [Link](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). In this part, we only used binary traits download from [GWAS Diagram](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/diagram).
